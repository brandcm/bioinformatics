# Jupyter Bash and R Kernels
You can't always code in Python. That's a lie. You (mostly) can. But you don't have to! Below is the code to use bash and R kernels in Jupyter Notebooks.

## Bash
`conda install -c conda-forge bash_kernel`

## R
`conda install -c conda-forge r-recommended`
`conda install -c conda-forge r-irkernel`
`R -e 'IRkernel::installspec()'`
